## Purpose
This document establishes the structure for identifying, managing, and classifying information assets throughout their life cycle to ensure appropriate levels of protection and
accountability, in compliance with ISO/IEC 27001:2022 stipulations.

## Scope
Applies to all information assets within the scope of Pym Technology’s Information
### Security Management System (ISMS): 
1. Physical devices
2. Software
3. Cloud environments
4. Data
5. Personnel with access to systems (Pym Technology’s employees, contractors, TPRM)

## Objectives
1. Ensure all assets are inventoried, classified, and assigned ownership.
2. Protect assets according to their value, sensitivity, and risk level.
3. Prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.
      
## Procedural Considerations
It is critical to obtain senior management buy-in. Establish roles and responsibilities for CMDB maintenance. Recommended procedures to gather the necessary documentation:
1. Leverage the current CMDB documents and systems. Use it as a starting point, and further as Asset Management program progresses.
2. Conduct an asset discovery activity by performing a network scan, and comparing the findings with the current list.
3. Validate the current CMDB assets with the IT team.
4. Reconcile discrepancies and update the CMDB accordingly.
5. Gather source to get a list of software and hardware assets from the IT team.
6. Collaborate with research teams to assess the types and locations of intellectual property. This is a critical asset for Pym Technology.
7. Obtain the rest of the assets from the remaining business units.
8. Reach out to the data governance and risk teams for asset classification based on sensitivity and criticality.
9. It is recommended that the IT team maintains ownership of the CMDB. There should be a process of regularly auditing and updating the CMDB of at least every 12 months.
